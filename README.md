# C# Playground ðŸš€

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my C# repository. This is a simple space where you'll find a bunch of random C# programs and projects. Feel free to explore and use the code as you wish.

## Quick Notice
I will have both full C# projects up and sometimes just the essential C# source code.

### Disclaimer
I am by no means a fully qualified Software Engineer. I am still a student learning how to securely code.
